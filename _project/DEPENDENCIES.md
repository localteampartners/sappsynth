# DEPENDENCIES — sappsynth

<!-- UPDATE WHEN: an external service/API is added or removed, an account changes hands, billing changes, or credentials rotate -->

External systems this project depends on. If access to any of these is lost,
part or all of the project stops working. This file tells you what to recover.

Runtime library dependencies live in `package.json` / `requirements.txt` /
similar — don't duplicate them here.
